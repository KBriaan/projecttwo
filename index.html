      [ Help with translations! ] Contents (Top) Controversial closure
      References <span>china Square</span> Article Talk Read Edit View history Tools From
      Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia China Square is a business hub located at
      Unicity Mall along Thika Road.[1] The mall became popular in Kenya for
      selling electronics, clothing, and different household items at lower
      costs than local stores.[2] Controversial closure After only one month of
      operating in Kenya, rival traders started complaining about prices and
      Kenya's Trade Minister, Moses Kuria, reinstated that Chinese investors
      would be supported as manufacturers not traders.[3] The Kenyan Trade
      Minister announced plans to lease the site to the competing small traders
      and support China Square owners in setting up a manufacturing plant in
      Kenya in order to work with distribution partnerships with traders in
      Eastleigh, Kamukunji, Muthurwa, River Road Traders, Gikomba, and
      Nyamakima.[4] On February 26, 2023, China Square announced it will be
      closely indefinitely.[5] The company initially cited public safety issues
      due to the high volume of traffic, shortage of tills and not being able to
      meet customer expectations.[6] Before closing, the mall reportedly sold
      Sh10 million ($78,678) worth of goods daily.[2] The Kenya China Chamber of
      Commerce (KCCC) criticized Trade Cabinet Secretary for proposing buying
      China Square's lease and evicting its owner without consultation, and
      violating Kenya's policy on having an unbiased environment for trade and
      investments.[7]

      NAIROBI, Kenya, Mar 6 – The controversial China Square store located at
      the Unicity mall near Kenyatta University has been reopened, a week after
      it was closed indefinitely.
    </h2>
    <p class="blue">
      Talks between the Kenyan government and the Chinese Community ungrilled
      the deadlock over the opening of the Chinese mall that has caused an
      uproar among the local traders. In a statement, the Kenya Chinese Chamber
      of Commerce mentioned they looked forward to equal and fair treatment to
      enable a conducive business environment. “The Kenya Chinese Chamber of
      Commerce welcomes the good news on the resumption of operations of China
      Square this follows several engagements between the Kenya Government and
      the Chinese Community in Kenya to reach an amicable solution to the
      stalemate and cooperation,” stated the Chinese Chamber of Commerce Trade
      and Investment Cabinet Secretary Moses Kuria had called for the mall’s
      closure, insisting that the Kenyatta University vice-chancellor buy out
      the lease from the Chinese Trader.
